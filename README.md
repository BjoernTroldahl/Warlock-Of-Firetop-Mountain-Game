# Warlock-Of-Firetop-Mountain-Game
A school project that I made as part of a 6 person team over the course of 4 months. 
It is a choice–driven branching narrative game made with Unity 2021.3.9f1, based on the all time classic choose-your-own-adventure book “The Warlock of Firetop Mountain”.
Version control was done with Plastic SCM, but I uploaded the project here on GitHub as well, for the sake of documentation.

### Our roles on the team were as follows:

Freya Gade — lead programmer, Cinemachine dolly track setup and voice acting
 
Bjørn Troldahl (me) — assistant programmer, Cinemachine dolly track setup, voice acting, sound designer and QA
 
Julius Winther — animation, shaders, Cinemachine dolly track setup and voice acting
 
Nickolai Jensen — game and level design, animation, shaders and voice acting
 
Maya Bordum — game and level design, Cinemachine dolly track setup, voice acting and QA
 
Frederik Stappert — project management, R&D and QA
