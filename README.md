# Warlock-Of-Firetop-Mountain-Game
 A school project that I made in collaboration with 5 other people. 
 Choice driven branching narrative game made with Unity 2021.3.9f1.
 Version control was done with Plastic SCM, but I have also uploaded the project here on GitHub for the sake of documentation.

 Our roles on the team were as follows:

 Freya Gade — lead programmer, Cinemachine dolly track setup and voice acting
 
 Bjørn Troldahl (me) — assistant programmer, Cinemachine dolly track setup, voice acting, sound designer and QA
 
 Julius Winther — animation, shaders, Cinemachine dolly track setup and voice acting
 
 Nickolai Jensen — game and level design, animation, shaders and voice acting
 
 Maya Bordum — game and level design, Cinemachine dolly track setup, voice acting and QA
